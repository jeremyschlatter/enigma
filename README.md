Playing with ideas about [enigma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine) and [bombe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombe).

I went to Bletchley Park recently and didn't fully understand how the bombe worked. I'm feeling curious about it and want to try thinking through it in code.

I also want an excuse to play with Rust.
